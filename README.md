## What is this?

This is just a bit about me and some of the recent projects I have completed.

## About me

My name is David and I am a recent graduate of the Thinkful Full Stack Web Development program. I have learned a tremendous amount and am looking forward to learn more and obtaining new skills everyday!

I currently work for an IT company in the Ft. Worth, TX area that specializes in custom video surveillance, access control, and alarm systems. It is a small company and there are many facets to my skillset in my current position. They include:

* web development and admisitration of current company site
* social media and marketing material creation (branding)
* raspberry pi integration and development
* providing technical assistance of both our company technicians while on the jobsite and customers that call in with issues of a technical nature
* linux command line and bash implementation and troubleshooting

I enjoy the technical challenges of my current position, but am look forwrd to streamlining my skillset toward web development and design.
Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio website!
